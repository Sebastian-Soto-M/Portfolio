<p>From the moment that the information began to be stored on computers and not on paper, members of these companies
    where the information was stored in this modern way registered the account that had protected this information well
    and make the computers a safe for the same The beginnings of this new era of managed information storage and
    technical analysts were responsible for finding security breaches to resolve them as affected. As time went by, they
    understood how to keep the best information, but in parallel many others were learning to reveal this data. These
    officials in charge of saving the information were at the same time responsible for safeguarding an institutional
    image of a reliable organization. Because of this, a greater focus is given to information security.</p>
<p>The unaffected accesses, together with a range of vulnerabilities and all kinds of threats related or directed
    towards information, were the order of the day. For some years before, many specialists linked to computer security
    have been studying and practicing intrusion methodologies in their work, laboratories or homes. Therefore,
    organizing to provide organizations with a service as external or contracted suppliers and, to give a fairly formal
    name, they called it ethical piracy. This concept includes the denominations of vulnerability scanning and
    penetration test, better known as network security assessment. To fully understand how ethical hacking works, it is
    necessary to talk about the work you are doing, since everyone is different. In general terms, the first and perhaps
    the most important step that must be followed to extract information is the recognition, which consists in obtaining
    the greatest amount of information about the victims before and during the interaction with it. in the system to
    gain quick access. Then these weaknesses are exploited to get into the system. Once inside the system you can search
    for the greatest possible access, in order to obtain the greatest amount of information. The next step is usually
    control over the system, to be able to send commands from where you are hacking. Then all the necessary information
    is extracted and the lines are covered when the record is deleted in the system. By doing this legally, with the
    permission of the system owner being penetrated, you are a white hat hacker. White hat hackers are extremely
    important for their problems, and what is responsible for preventing information theft.</p>
<p>Ethical hacking is the act of a person with security and computer skills in conducting network tests to measure
    security and modify without committing any harm or crime, in other words, it consists in taking the role of a cyber
    criminal for simulating attacks. company, in order to find weaknesses in the security of your system, so that they
    can be reinforced. It is called ethical hacking because in order to emulate the attack methodology of a computer
    intruder and not be, it has to have a medium ethic, beyond all the conditions, terms and assets that are around the
    case. Imagine that the authorities of a bank hire someone to simulate a robbery (without an armed hand, of course)
    and thereby control the efficiency of your security system. In this paper we will analyze the process by which this
    takes place and its main contributions to security. This document will explain the forms of hacking but focusing on
    ethical hacking and its contributions in the area of ​​security.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-hacker">¿What does it mean to be a hacker?</h2>
<p>Commonly the term is associated with all those computer experts who use their technical knowledge to overcome a
    problem, usually associated with security. It is usually used in computer science with knowledge in security and
    with the ability to detect errors or failures in computer systems and then report the failures to the developers of
    the software found vulnerable or to the public. It is every individual who is dedicated to programming
    enthusiastically, that is, an enthusiastic expert of any kind, who considers that making information available to
    everyone constitutes an extraordinary good. A full Hacker has the ability to master in a good percentage several
    aspects such as: programming languages, hardware and software manipulation, telecommunications, and others; All this
    can be done to make a profit, make yourself known, motivated, hobby or to carry out non-profit activities. The
    hackers have been mistakenly classified as a single community, however, there is a classification within them that
    separates each one’s intentions. Let’s see these classifications that will help us understand their purposes.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Black Hat Hackers</li>
</ul>
<p>    * Black Hat Hackers or Black Hat Hackers are the bad guys, who are commonly referred to as simple Hackers. The
    term is used a lot specifically for Hackers that break the security of a computer, a network or create computer
    viruses.     * Black Hat Hackers continually look for ways to get in or break the security of what they want, making
    White Hat Hackers life harder. Black Hat Hackers often look for the path of least resistance, whether due to some
    vulnerability, human error, laziness or some new method of attack. The number one motivation of a Black Hat Hacker
    is money.     * The classification of Black Hat comes from the identification of villains in the old movies of the
    Old West that typically wore Black Hats.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>White Hat Hackers</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The White Hat Hackers or White Hat Hackers are the good guys, the ethical ones. They are regularly those
                that penetrate the security of systems to find vulnerabilities. Some are security consultants, they work
                for a company in the area of ​​computer security protecting Black Hat Hackers systems.</li>
            <li>Some White Hat Hackers were Black Hats and jumped on the side of the good or have knowledge of them and
                use them to do good.</li>
            <li>The White Hat classification comes from the identification of the Heroes in the old movies of the Old
                West that typically wore White Hats.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Gray Hat Hackers
        <ul>
            <li>The Gray Hat Hackers or Gray Hat Hackers are the ones that play good and bad, in other words, they have
                ambiguous ethics. They have the knowledge of a Black Hat Hacker and use them to penetrate systems and
                look for vulnerabilities and then offer their services to repair them under contract.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Crackers
        <ul>
            <li>Crackers fall on the side of the Black Hats. These commonly enter vulnerable systems and harm either
                stealing information, leaving a virus, malware or trojan in the system and create backdoors to enter
                again when they please.</li>
            <li>Crackers are also known as those who design programs to break Softwares security, expand the
                functionality of the original hardware or software known as Cracks, Key Generators, etc. They do this
                many times by reverse engineering.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Script Kiddies</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Script Kiddies are known to Hackers who use other people’s written programs to penetrate a system,
                computer network, web page, etc. since they have little knowledge about what is happening internally in
                programming.</li>

            <li>The Phreaker can be said to be the Hacker of telephone systems, mobile telephony, wireless tenoligies
                and Voice over IP (VoIP). A phreaker is a person who investigates telephone systems, through the use of
                technology for the pleasure of manipulating a technologically complex system and sometimes also to be
                able to obtain some type of benefit such as free calls.</li>

            <li>The Lammer is nothing more and nothing less than Hacker is believed and does not have the necessary
                knowledge or logic to understand what is really happening when you use a program already made to hack
                and break some security.</li>

    <li>
        <p>Hacktivists</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Some hacker activists are motivated by politics or religion, while others may want to report abuse, or
                revenge, or simply harass their target for their own entertainment. A hacktivist uses the same tools and
                techniques of a hacker, but does so in order to interrupt services and pay attention to a political or
                social cause.</li>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>
<p>An ethical hacker identifies potential threats and companies are challenged to reduce all identified risks, which
    must be understood and managed in a timely manner thus ensuring productivity.</p>
<p>It is important that in an annual budget and / or plan the necessary resources are reserved for the realization of
    specialized projects in security matters, including penetration studies (internal and perimeter), Ethical Hacking,
    vulnerability analysis and explosion, depending on The company has a comprehensive and global image of its
    technological management. Every action of a human being brings different ethical, bad and good perspectives; The
    Hacker Ethics has as its main objective, to give you another point of view the people who dedicate their
    professional life to violate information systems, to turn this into a method of protection, allowing all
    organizations to attack and improve their solutions.</p>
<p>There are those who consider that being a Hacker means that he likes to hurt people, during all this work we tried to
    show the other side of a hacker, and take into account that knowledge can give us power that can be well or misused.

From the moment that the information began to be stored on computers and not on paper, members of these companies where the information was stored in this modern way registered the account that had protected this information well and make the computers a safe for the same The beginnings of this new era of managed information storage and technical analysts were responsible for finding security breaches to resolve them as affected. As time went by, they understood how to keep the best information, but in parallel many others were learning to reveal this data. These officials in charge of saving the information were at the same time responsible for safeguarding an institutional image of a reliable organization. Because of this, a greater focus is given to information security.

The unaffected accesses, together with a range of vulnerabilities and all kinds of threats related or directed towards information, were the order of the day. For some years before, many specialists linked to computer security have been studying and practicing intrusion methodologies in their work, laboratories or homes. Therefore, organizing to provide organizations with a service as external or contracted suppliers and, to give a fairly formal name, they called it ethical piracy. This concept includes the denominations of vulnerability scanning and penetration test, better known as network security assessment. To fully understand how ethical hacking works, it is necessary to talk about the work you are doing, since everyone is different. In general terms, the first and perhaps the most important step that must be followed to extract information is the recognition, which consists in obtaining the greatest amount of information about the victims before and during the interaction with it. in the system to gain quick access. Then these weaknesses are exploited to get into the system. Once inside the system you can search for the greatest possible access, in order to obtain the greatest amount of information. The next step is usually control over the system, to be able to send commands from where you are hacking. Then all the necessary information is extracted and the lines are covered when the record is deleted in the system. By doing this legally, with the permission of the system owner being penetrated, you are a white hat hacker. White hat hackers are extremely important for their problems, and what is responsible for preventing information theft.

Ethical hacking is the act of a person with security and computer skills in conducting network tests to measure security and modify without committing any harm or crime, in other words, it consists in taking the role of a cyber criminal for simulating attacks. company, in order to find weaknesses in the security of your system, so that they can be reinforced. It is called ethical hacking because in order to emulate the attack methodology of a computer intruder and not be, it has to have a medium ethic, beyond all the conditions, terms and assets that are around the case. Imagine that the authorities of a bank hire someone to simulate a robbery (without an armed hand, of course) and thereby control the efficiency of your security system.
In this paper we will analyze the process by which this takes place and its main contributions to security. This document will explain the forms of hacking but focusing on ethical hacking and its contributions in the area of ​​security.

## ¿What does it mean to be a hacker?
Commonly the term is associated with all those computer experts who use their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, usually associated with security. It is usually used in computer science with knowledge in security and with the ability to detect errors or failures in computer systems and then report the failures to the developers of the software found vulnerable or to the public.
It is every individual who is dedicated to programming enthusiastically, that is, an enthusiastic expert of any kind, who considers that making information available to everyone constitutes an extraordinary good.
A full Hacker has the ability to master in a good percentage several aspects such as: programming languages, hardware and software manipulation, telecommunications, and others; All this can be done to make a profit, make yourself known, motivated, hobby or to carry out non-profit activities.
The hackers have been mistakenly classified as a single community, however, there is a classification within them that separates each one's intentions. Let's see these classifications that will help us understand their purposes.

## What is an ethical hacker supposed to do? 

### Stages of a security evaluation process: 

* Preparation: You must have a signed contract in writing where the ethical hacker is exonerated of any responsibility as a result of the tests performed (provided it is within the agreed framework)
* Management: Preparation of a report detailing the tests and possible vulnerabilities detected.
* Conclusion: Communication to the company of the report and of the possible solutions.

### Ways to perform an ethical hack
* Remote networks: Simulation of an attack from the Internet.
* Local networks: Simulation of an attack from within (employees, hacker who has obtained privileges on a system)
* Social engineering: Test the confidence of employees.
* Physical security: Physical access (equipment, backup tapes)

### Evaluating security

#### Types of pentesting
* Black-box (without previous knowledge of the infrastructure about to evaluate)
* White-box (with full knowledge of the infrastructure being evaluated)
* Internal test (also known as Gray-box testing, the network is examined from within)

#### Information is presented by the ethical hacker

**Information gathered must be confidential**

* Ethical Hacking Report
* Detailed results of the activities and hacking tests performed
* The vulnerabilities will be detailed and it is suggested how to avoid using them

## Hacker Types

* Black Hat Hackers

    * Black Hat Hackers or Black Hat Hackers are the bad guys, who are commonly referred to as simple Hackers. The term is used a lot specifically for Hackers that break the security of a computer, a network or create computer viruses.
    * Black Hat Hackers continually look for ways to get in or break the security of what they want, making White Hat Hackers life harder. Black Hat Hackers often look for the path of least resistance, whether due to some vulnerability, human error, laziness or some new method of attack. The number one motivation of a Black Hat Hacker is money.
    * The classification of Black Hat comes from the identification of villains in the old movies of the Old West that typically wore Black Hats.

* White Hat Hackers

    * The White Hat Hackers or White Hat Hackers are the good guys, the ethical ones. They are regularly those that penetrate the security of systems to find vulnerabilities. Some are security consultants, they work for a company in the area of ​​computer security protecting Black Hat Hackers systems.
    * Some White Hat Hackers were Black Hats and jumped on the side of the good or have knowledge of them and use them to do good.
    * The White Hat classification comes from the identification of the Heroes in the old movies of the Old West that typically wore White Hats.

* Gray Hat Hackers
    * The Gray Hat Hackers or Gray Hat Hackers are the ones that play good and bad, in other words, they have ambiguous ethics. They have the knowledge of a Black Hat Hacker and use them to penetrate systems and look for vulnerabilities and then offer their services to repair them under contract.

* Crackers
    * Crackers fall on the side of the Black Hats. These commonly enter vulnerable systems and harm either stealing information, leaving a virus, malware or trojan in the system and create backdoors to enter again when they please.
    * Crackers are also known as those who design programs to break Softwares security, expand the functionality of the original hardware or software known as Cracks, Key Generators, etc. They do this many times by reverse engineering.

* Script Kiddies

    * Script Kiddies are known to Hackers who use other people's written programs to penetrate a system, computer network, web page, etc. since they have little knowledge about what is happening internally in programming.

* Phreaker

    * The Phreaker can be said to be the Hacker of telephone systems, mobile telephony, wireless tenoligies and Voice over IP (VoIP). A phreaker is a person who investigates telephone systems, through the use of technology for the pleasure of manipulating a technologically complex system and sometimes also to be able to obtain some type of benefit such as free calls.

* Lammer

    * The Lammer is nothing more and nothing less than Hacker is believed and does not have the necessary knowledge or logic to understand what is really happening when you use a program already made to hack and break some security.

* Hacktivists

    * Some hacker activists are motivated by politics or religion, while others may want to report abuse, or revenge, or simply harass their target for their own entertainment. A hacktivist uses the same tools and techniques of a hacker, but does so in order to interrupt services and pay attention to a political or social cause.

* Carder

    * Expert in credit card fraud. They generate fake numbers and access codes that successfully violate control systems to steal and clone cards.

* Pharmer

    * They are engaged in phishing attacks, where the user believes that he is entering a real site and actually enters his data into one created by the hacker. They subsequently use the credentials to steal funds from their victims' accounts.

* War driver

    * They are crackers who know how to exploit the vulnerabilities of all types of mobile connection networks.

* Defacer
    
    * They look for web page bugs on the internet to be able to infiltrate them and thus modify them.

* Spammer and Spywares disseminators

    * There are companies that pay them for the creation of spam of their main products and in other cases they also profit from illegal advertising.

    
## Overall

An ethical hacker identifies potential threats and companies are challenged to reduce all identified risks, which must be understood and managed in a timely manner thus ensuring productivity.

It is important that in an annual budget and / or plan the necessary resources are reserved for the realization of specialized projects in security matters, including penetration studies (internal and perimeter), Ethical Hacking, vulnerability analysis and explosion, depending on The company has a comprehensive and global image of its technological management. Every action of a human being brings different ethical, bad and good perspectives; The Hacker Ethics has as its main objective, to give you another point of view the people who dedicate their professional life to violate information systems, to turn this into a method of protection, allowing all organizations to attack and improve their solutions.

There are those who consider that being a Hacker means that he likes to hurt people, during all this work we tried to show the other side of a hacker, and take into account that knowledge can give us power that can be well or misused.

Agile methodologies are variables that allow adapting the way of working to the conditions of the project, achieving flexibility and immediacy in the response to adapt the project and its development to the specific circumstances of the environment. Companies that opt ​​for this methodology manage to manage their projects in a flexible, autonomous and efficient way, reducing costs and increasing their productivity.

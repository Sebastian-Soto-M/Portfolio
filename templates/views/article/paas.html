This platform is installed in a storage, computing and networking infrastructure, in other words the physical space and the hardware elements that are needed so that these previously mentioned applications can be used.</p>
<p>Platform as a service “PAAS”, is a platform for development and hosting of applications of a company. This means that it takes care of the aforementioned, but with a big difference: these are a space in the cloud that allows customers to have secure access to the services acquired through the internet, paying only for the requested services.

<p>On these platforms you can hire some services that are managed by software from the provider, in these cases, this software is used as SaaS.</p>

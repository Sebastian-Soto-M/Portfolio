<p>In order to understand what a platform as a service is, it is important to understand what platform means by itself.
    For example in a company, the applications: Administrative Systems, ERP, CRM, run on a platform, which consists of
    middleware, database and operating system. This platform is installed in a storage, computing and networking
    infrastructure, in other words the physical space and the hardware elements that are needed so that these previously
    mentioned applications can be used.</p>
<p>Plaform as a service (PaaS) is a platform for the development and hosting of company applications. These platforms
    are a cloud space that allows customers to have secure access to services purchased over the Internet, paying only
    for the services requested.

        <ul>
            <li>Allows customers a finite number of customizations</li>
            <li>Cheaper than a private platform, but with several of its advantages</li>

In order to understand what a platform as a service is, it is important to understand what platform means by itself.
For example in a company, the applications: Administrative Systems, ERP, CRM, run on a platform, which consists of
middleware, database and operating system. This platform is installed in a storage, computing and networking
infrastructure, in other words the physical space and the hardware elements that are needed so that these previously
mentioned applications can be used.

Plaform as a service (PaaS) is a platform for the development and hosting of company applications. These platforms are a cloud space that allows customers to have secure access to services purchased over the Internet, paying only for the services requested.

## Types
* Public

* Private

    * More control from the client on the applications

* Hybrid
    * Allows customers a finite number of customizations
    * Cheaper than a private platform, but with several of its advantages
